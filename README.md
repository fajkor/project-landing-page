Project: Landing Page Repository

This is my second project on The Odin Project carriculum. For my second project I will be building a landing page. Images of the design of the landing page and of the fonts and colors are provided by The Odin Project. We -the learners- should build a similar looking landing page. We are allowed to tweak it and make it our own. The images can be found in the links below.

The purpose of this project is to implement and furthur solidify what we have learnt so far in the curriculum. That is, HTML and CSS basics.
For this project I will be using link tags, list tags, div containers, header, footer, etc.  
To style the webpage I will be relying on the CSS Flexbox and the Box Model.

A note: You will see that in my code I comment a lot. I do this for three reasons. First, to reinforce my learning. Second, as a reference. When I run into a similar problem in future projects, I can come back here and see if I can get an idea of how to solve it. And third, when I come back to my project it's easier for me to continue from where I have left of.
